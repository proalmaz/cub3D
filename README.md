# cub3D
## Description
Repeat raycasting in Wolfenstein 3D, using the miniLibX library. The main task: to explore the path of the rays, to make a dynamic view inside the maze.

In this project, I use some functions from [my libft library](https://github.com/proalmaz/libft.git), as well as some functions we modify.

The compilation was performed as follows: `gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror *.o -L. -lmlx -lft -framework OpenGL -framework AppKit -o cub3d`

All files pass to Norminette.

No memory leaks.

# Using

```
git clone https://github.com/proalmaz/cub3D.git
cd cub3d
make
./cub3D map.cub
```
![Alt Text](https://github.com/proalmaz/cub3D/blob/master/ray_casting.gif)

`make` and `make all` compile the library libfе.a and libmlx.dylib, placing them in the root folder.

`make re` deletes all .o files, deletes libfе.a and libmlx.dylib, rebuilds the project.

`make clean` deletes all .o files.

`make fclean` deletes all .o files, also deletes libfе.a and libmlx.dylib.

# Configuration file map.cub
This file is given as first argument to a program and contains info about:

## Screen resolution
North, South, East, West textrures for walls and sprite in .xpm files
## Ceiling and floor color in RGB format
Map where 1 - wall, 0 - empty space, N/W/E/S - initial direction of a player, 2 - sprite
## Checking the validity of map.cub
If any misconfiguration of any kind is encountered in the file, the program must exit properly and return "Error\n" followed by an explicit error message. Some of requirements are subjective.

## Screenshot
`./cub3D [map.cub] --save`

Program is saving the first rendered image in bmp format when its second argument is --save.
